841. Keys and Rooms

There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

  const stack = [rooms[0]]
  rooms[0] = []
  while (stack.length) {
    const keys = stack.pop()
    for (const key of keys) {
      stack.push(rooms[key])
      rooms[key] = []
    }
  }
  return rooms.filter(keys => keys.length > 0).length == 0
}
```
