### 题目
2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital

There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) structure country network consisting of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 roads. The capital city is city 0. You are given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

There is a meeting for the representatives of each city. The meeting is in the capital city.

There is a car in each city. You are given an integer seats that indicates the number of seats in each car.

A representative can use the car in their city to travel or change the car and ride with another representative. The cost of traveling between two cities is one liter of fuel.

Return the minimum number of liters of fuel to reach the capital city.

### 思路
1. 因为是树形结构，所以每个代表的路线是唯一的，路过某个城市的代表人数也是确定的
2. 因为只考虑燃油经济性，不考虑时间效率，所以最优解是等一个城市的所有代表到齐后拼车前往下一个城市

### 代码
```javascript
// runtime 96.43% memory 85.71%
var minimumFuelCost = function(roads, seats) {
  const n = roads.length + 1
  const graph = []
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    graph[i] = []
  }
  for (const road of roads) {
    graph[road[0]].push(road[1])
    graph[road[1]].push(road[0])
  }
  let res = 0
  function dfs(node, parent) {
    let people = 1
    for (const child of graph[node]) {
      if (child == parent) continue
      people += dfs(child, node)
    }
    if (node > 0) {
      res += Math.ceil(people / seats)
    }
    return people
  }
  dfs(0, 0)
  return res
}
```
