2360. Longest Cycle in a Graph

You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
// runtime 100% memory 94.34%
var longestCycle = function(edges) {
  const n = edges.length
  let res = -1
  for (let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
    if (edges[i] < 0) continue
    const base = -1 - n * i
    let val = base
    let node = i
    while (edges[node] >= 0) {
      const next = edges[node]
      edges[node] = --val
      node = next
    }
    if (edges[node] <= base - 1 && edges[node] >= base - n) {
      res = Math.max(res, edges[node] - val + 1)
    }
  }
  return res
}
```
