1143. Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

二维动态规划
```
dp[i][0] = 0
dp[0][j] = 0
dp[i+1][i+1] = 1 + dp[i][j], text1[i] == text2[j]
dp[i+1][i+1] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j]), text1[i] != text2[j]
```

### 代码
```javascript
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    const dp = []
    dp[0] = Array(text2.length + 1).fill(0)
    for (let i = 0; i < text1.length; i++) {
      dp[i+1] = [0]
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < text1.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < text2.length; j++) {
        if (text1[i] == text2[j]) {
          dp[i+1][j+1] = 1 + dp[i][j]
        } else {
          dp[i+1][j+1] = Math.max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])
        }
      }
    }
    return dp[text1.length][text2.length]
}
```
