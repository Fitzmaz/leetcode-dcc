309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

* After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### 思路
`dp[i]`表示从0到i天可获得的最大利润。在第i天有三种选择，买入/卖出/休息。因为买入不如休息，所以只有卖出/休息两种选择。
在第i天选择卖出时，需要在第i-j天选择买入，j的取值范围是[1, i]

sell的状态转移方程推导过程
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], prices[i] + sell[i])

sell[i] = max(dp[i-j-2] - prices[i-j]), j in [1, i]
sell[i+1] = max(dp[i+1-j-2] - prices[i+1-j]), j in [1, i+1]
          = max(dp[i-j-2] - prices[i-j]), j in [0, i]
          = max(sell[i], dp[i-2] - prices[i])
```

### 代码
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  const n = prices.length
  const dp = []
  const sell = []
  dp[-1] = 0
  dp[0] = 0
  sell[1] = -prices[0]

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], prices[i] + sell[i])
    sell[i+1] = Math.max(sell[i], dp[i-2] - prices[i])
  }
  return dp[n-1]
}
```

尝试用回溯算法，通过了208/210的case，最后超时
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let max = -1
  function dfs(i, profit, buyDay) {
    if (i >= prices.length) {
      max = Math.max(max, profit)
      return
    }
    if (buyDay < 0) {
      dfs(i + 1, profit, buyDay)
      dfs(i + 1, profit, i)
    } else {
      dfs(i + 1, profit, buyDay)
      dfs(i + 2, profit + prices[i] - prices[buyDay], -1)
    }
  }
  dfs(0, 0, -1)
  return max
}
```
