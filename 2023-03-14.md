### 题目
129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

* For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
// runtime 82.68% memory 22.31%
var sumNumbers = function(root) {
  let sum = 0
  function dfs(node) {
    if (node == null) return 0
    let count = 0
    count += dfs(node.left)
    count += dfs(node.right)
    count = Math.max(count, 1)
    sum += count * node.val
    return count * 10
  }
  dfs(root)
  return sum
}
```
