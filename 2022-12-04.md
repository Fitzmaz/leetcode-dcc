2256. Minimum Average Difference

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

Note:

* The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
* The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.
* The average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
var minimumAverageDifference = function(nums) {
  function average(sum, n) {
    return n == 0 ? 0 : Math.floor(sum / n)
  }
  const n = nums.length
  let sum1 = 0
  let sum2 = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum2 += nums[i]
  }
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  let minIndex = -1
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum1 += nums[i]
    sum2 -= nums[i]
    const diff = Math.abs(average(sum1, (i + 1)) - average(sum2, (n - i - 1)))
    if (diff < min) {
      min = diff
      minIndex = i
    }
  }
  return minIndex
};
```
