1402. Reducing Dishes

A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i].

Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
// runtime 93.90% memory 89.2%
var maxSatisfaction = function(sati) {
  sati.sort((a, b) => b - a)
  let sum = 0
  let coe = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < sati.length; i++) {
    sum += sati[i]
    if (sum < 0) return coe
    coe += sum
  }
  return coe
}
```
