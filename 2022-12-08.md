872. Leaf-Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
var leafSimilar = function(root1, root2) {
  function dfs(root, leaves) {
    const stack = []
    stack.push(root)
    while (stack.length) {
      const node = stack.pop()
      if (node == null) continue
      if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
        leaves.push(node)
      }
      stack.push(node.right)
      stack.push(node.left)
    }
  }

  const leaves1 = []
  const leaves2 = []
  dfs(root1, leaves1)
  dfs(root2, leaves2)
  
  return leaves1.length == leaves2.length && leaves1.every((node, index) => node.val == leaves2[index].val)
}
```
