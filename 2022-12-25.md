### 题目
2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from `nums` such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `queries[i]`.

A ***subsequence*** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### 思路

### 代码
```javascript
var answerQueries = function(nums, queries) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  for (let i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
    let size = 0
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      queries[i] -= nums[j]
      if (queries[i] < 0) {
        break
      }
      size++
    }
    queries[i] = size
  }
  return queries
}
```
